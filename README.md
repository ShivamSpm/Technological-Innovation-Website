### Overview
I created this project to provide a platform for individuals passionate about writing and sharing their blogs. As someone who loves reading technical blog posts and writing few myself, I think this website would be very helpful for the people who share the same passion as mine. I have added 6 categories - Art, Science, Technology, Cinema, Design and Food, into which people can create blog post. My main motivation behind developing this website was, I wanted a single place to save blogs I find interesting from different sources.

### Features

* User-friendly interface
* 6 Categories for easy navigation
* User authentication for secure posting
* Editing and deleting blogs by authorized users

-----------------------------------------

### Implementation
* Built with React for the front-end, utilizing Node.js for the server-side logic, and integrated with a MySQL database for data management.
* Created a dynamic Home page that aggregates and displays blog posts from all available categories.
* Implemented a user-friendly navigation system by incorporating individual category links in the navigation bar. Clicking on a category reveals related blog posts.
* Designed a Blog Writing page enabling users to compose and publish blogs within any of the six specified categories.
* Implemented a feature allowing users to click on individual blog posts for reading. Additionally, authorized users possess the capability to edit existing blogs for continuous refinement.
