          The use of technology in defense improves military computing thinking for intelligence,
          surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The use of autonomous weapon systems and equipment safety
          management by computer vision reduces the number of casualties among soldiers.

            An AI-based decision-making
            engine is being developed by a
            startup named Axon Vision. With
            the help of computer vision, the
            startup's edge360 offering gives
            ground vehicles a complete,
            automated situational awareness.
            Another startup named Rebellion
            develops AI products for the
            defense. For mission success, the
            startup employs machine learning
            and the power of data to prevent
            risks.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Cyber attacks have increased a lot in
            military systems to steal or damage
            the classified military information.
            Additionally, militaries are
            developing offensive cyber warfare
            capabilities, including phishing and
            ransomware. Blockchain ensures
            data security while sharing
            information with all parties
            involved. So, many defense
            companies are employing blockchain
            technology.

          Big Data and Analytics
        </h3>
        <p>
          Information is a powerful thing. Using big data, militaries can extract the information
          and analyze it to their advantage to build weaponry that is better than their
          opponents. This will give them a huge strategic advantage. Analytics also makes it
          possible to evaluate data collected from the Internet of medical things infrastructure
          effectively.
